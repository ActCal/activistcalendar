This repo is where activistcalendar.org is developed and deployed from!

## Overview
The mission of Activist Calendar is to strengthen Boston-based networks of organizers, artivists, hacktivists and engaged community members with tools and programming that support collaborations and community resource-building. We do this through our online calendar, social media (Facebook and Twitter) and in-person events (in development).

Activist Calendar will be an online calendar tool for activists to share their work and events around Boston. This searchable and sortable calendar will allow organizers to learn about each other and their work as a way to enable communication and collaboration. Community members can use the calendar to learn about groups, events and ways to engage.
